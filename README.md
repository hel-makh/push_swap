# push_swap

This project is the 7th project as a student at 1337. It involves sorting data on a stack using another stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, we will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.
